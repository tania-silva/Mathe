     <td>Student self-assessment and video lessons are most useful for me because it helps to practice more problems ranging from simple to difficult and also helps with the videos on the given topic for the difficult problems that we cannot solve. And also, there is help from the teachers and fellow students for our confusion and doubts through community of practice.  My suggestion would be if it can include more topics from calculus and discrete mathematics like surface integrals, set theory, etc</td>

On the other hand, the MathE library, which is a revised repertoire, configures itself as a very reliable source to be indicated to the student, as complementary material.</td>

     <td>At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution characterised by an unprecedented development of science and technology Europe is facing a paradoxical challenge: students, even higher education students studying scientific and economics subjects such as engineering and Economics, often lack the basic maths skills to effectively follow their lectures. It is imperative to find the most effective solutions and to prepare students for a world where mathematics is of central importance and extensively applied to diverse fields. The MathE project resources are on my top of preferences for the excellence students on Math.</td>

     <td>The most useful source for me was being able to interact and view the ""Community of Practice"" source, as I had access to a community full of willingness to interact, share and disseminate ideas, knowledge, platforms and much more. It was undoubtedly very interesting to meet different people from different countries, whether in a context of students and/or teachers and where I could discuss some current topics, conferences, and/or disruptive tools for mathematics.
I emphasize that the ""Student's Assessment Toolkit"" was undoubtedly essential in the learning of my students, who can learn, train, and be assessed in the most diverse mathematical contexts, all on a single platform, well designed and easy to use. I contributed to the question bank, but without a doubt I also took advantage of several topics from other colleagues.

After passing the test, you have to work on incorrect questions, and E-library helps to remember those parts of math that you could forget and did not train for a long time, also you can do it by way which is more comfortable for you.

tutoring system (ITS) helps the students to perform better in their education and brings remarkable satisfaction by having materials (documentation and explanatory videos) that the ITS system has given to students in areas where it has noticed a lack of skills by this method the student can go from self-criticism to an education directly related to his weak point, resulting in a completion of his background.
