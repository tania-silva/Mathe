The assumption is that learning difficulties in mathematics do not often occur with clarity and simplicity. They manifest themselves differently in different people, and are often left undiagnosed. Therefore the project aims at promoting the acquisition of skills and key competences with a specific focus on addressing underachievement in maths.";
